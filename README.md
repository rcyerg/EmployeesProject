# HELLO MIKAILA

I didn't know how to fit this code into a
*single* README file. So I decided to 
just take the time to learn **basic** markdown
syntax instead.

>Inside this repo, you will find a **main** employee class
**three** subclasses extending the main employee class
and a **final** subclass extending one of the subclasses.
>
>Each Class has its *own* method, and the classes that
extend a class is shown using the superclass's 
exclusive method.
>
>I also studied some more about access level
modifiers, as you can see. 

Here are some notes about the project: 

- It was fun to make subclasses

- I need to study more about static and non-static contexts
since they weren't used at all outside of the main 
method. 

- I'm curious how all this applies to a front-end
context. 
    -How does java interact with what a user
    sees?

`System.out.println("Here is a block of code in a README.md file);`
